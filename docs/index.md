# Refac Tools

A comprehensive collection of robust, cross-platform command-line tools for file and directory operations. The suite includes **refac** for string replacement, **scrap** for smart file management, and **unscrap** for file restoration. Designed for safety, reliability, and performance, making them suitable for mission-critical operations.

## Tools Overview

### üîÑ Refac - String Replacement Tool
- **Dual Operation**: Replace strings in both file/directory names AND file contents
- **Safety First**: Collision detection, dry-run mode, and binary file protection
- **High Performance**: Multi-threaded processing with progress tracking
- **Flexible Filtering**: Include/exclude patterns with glob and regex support

### üóÇÔ∏è Scrap - Smart File Management
- **Temporary Storage**: Move files to `.scrap` folder with automatic organization
- **Metadata Tracking**: Remember original locations and timestamps
- **Advanced Operations**: List, search, clean, archive, and restore capabilities
- **Git Integration**: Automatic `.gitignore` management

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Unscrap - File Restoration
- **Smart Recovery**: Restore files to their original locations
- **Undo Operations**: Quickly undo the last scrap action
- **Custom Destinations**: Restore to any location
- **Conflict Handling**: Safe restoration with overwrite protection

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Safety First**: Collision detection, confirmation prompts, and atomic operations
- **Performance Optimized**: Multi-threaded processing and efficient file handling
- **User Friendly**: Clear error messages and comprehensive help

## Quick Start

### Refac - String Replacement
```bash
# Basic string replacement
refac . "oldname" "newname"

# Preview changes first (recommended)
refac . "oldname" "newname" --dry-run

# Only rename files/directories (skip content)
refac . "oldname" "newname" --names-only
```

### Scrap - File Management
```bash
# Move files to .scrap folder
scrap old_file.txt temp_directory/

# List contents of .scrap folder
scrap

# Search for files
scrap find "*.log"

# Clean old items (30+ days)
scrap clean

# Archive and remove all items
scrap archive --remove
```

### Unscrap - File Restoration
```bash
# Restore last scrapped item
unscrap

# Restore specific file
unscrap filename.txt

# Restore to custom location
unscrap filename.txt --to /new/location/
```

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/refac
cd refac
cargo build --release

# Install all tools
cargo install --path .

# Or install individual tools
cargo install --path . --bin refac
cargo install --path . --bin scrap
cargo install --path . --bin unscrap
```

## How It Works

Refac performs two types of operations:

1. **Name Replacement**: Renames files and directories containing the target string
2. **Content Replacement**: Replaces strings inside text files (automatically skips binary files)

By default, both operations are performed. Use mode flags to limit the scope:

- `--names-only`: Only rename files/directories
- `--content-only`: Only replace file contents
- `--files-only`: Process files but not directories
- `--dirs-only`: Process directories but not files

## Safety Features

- **Collision Detection**: Prevents overwriting existing files
- **Binary File Detection**: Automatically skips binary files for content replacement
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview all changes before applying them
- **Backup Support**: Create backups of modified files
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive confirmation (unless `--force` is used)

## Performance

- **Multi-threaded**: Parallel content processing for large codebases
- **Streaming**: Efficient handling of large files
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with detailed information
- **Smart Filtering**: Process only relevant files with include/exclude patterns

## Common Use Cases

### Project Refactoring

```bash
# Rename a class throughout a codebase
refac ./src "OldClassName" "NewClassName"

# Rename variables (case-sensitive)
refac ./project "old_variable" "new_variable"
```

### File Organization

```bash
# Rename files only, skip content
refac ./docs "draft" "final" --names-only

# Update file contents only, keep names
refac ./config "old.example.com" "new.example.com" --content-only
```

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Process specific file types
refac ./src "oldname" "newname" --include "*.rs" --include "*.toml"

# Exclude certain directories
refac ./project "oldname" "newname" --exclude "target/*" --exclude "*.log"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test first**: Use `--dry-run` to preview changes
2. **Use version control**: Commit your code before running refac
3. **Create backups**: Use `--backup` for important changes
4. **Be specific**: Use include/exclude patterns to limit scope
5. **Test after changes**: Run your tests after refactoring
